            <p>At IvI Bookstore, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.
                This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use

            <br>

            <h4>Information Sharing:</h4>
            We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share your
            information with trusted service providers who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business,
            or providing services to you. These service providers are obligated to keep your information confidential
            and are only allowed to use it for the purposes specified by us.
            We may also share your information when required by law, to protect our rights and safety, or to comply with
            a legal process.
            <br>

            We take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse,
            or alteration. However, no data transmission over the internet is completely secure. We strive to use
            commercially acceptable means to protect your information, but we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other
            operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the updated policy
